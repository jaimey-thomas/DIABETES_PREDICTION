#  Diabetes Prediction using Streamlit & K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project is a **machine learning web app** built using **Streamlit** and the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm.  
It predicts whether a patient is **diabetic** or **not diabetic** based on various medical parameters.

 User-friendly Streamlit interface  
 Real-time diabetes prediction  
 Uses StandardScaler for data normalization  
 Built with the famous **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**  
 Deployed locally or can be hosted online using Streamlit Cloud
